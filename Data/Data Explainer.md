Raw data on compliance checks completed since 2010 are publicly available for download from an FDA website, as well as a map
feature that can display local compliance check outcomes: US Food and Drug Administration.  Available at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/oce/inspections/oce_insp_searching.cfm

The data are imported as comma-separated values to the Legacy GIS platform from the FDA Center for Tobacco Products website.7 Each line of data describes either a single compliance check or a notification of a Civil Monetary Penalty.

The FDA continuously updates its compliance check database, making all new data available for download once a month.
Unlike these violation documents, the raw data do not include a unique identifier for each store, nor the date the inspection was completed; only the date that a decision was made about the inspection is provided. To track repeat inspections, each line of data was read into a separate record and unique store names were created from the name and address provided.
